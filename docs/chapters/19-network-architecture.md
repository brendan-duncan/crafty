# Chapter 19: Network Architecture

[Contents](../crafty.md) | [18-User Interface](18-user-interface.md) | [20-Multiplayer Gameplay](20-multiplayer-gameplay.md)

Crafty supports multiplayer through a WebSocket-based server written in Node.js. The protocol is minimal and message-oriented.

## 19.1 WebSocket Fundamentals

WebSocket provides a persistent, full-duplex connection between the browser and the server. Crafty's client (`crafty/game/network_client.ts`) establishes the connection:

```typescript
class NetworkClient {
  private _ws: WebSocket;
  private _connected = false;

  async connect(address: string, playerName: string): Promise<void> {
    this._ws = new WebSocket(`ws://${address}`);
    // ... onopen, onmessage, onclose handlers ...

    // Send hello immediately on connect
    this._ws.onopen = () => {
      this._connected = true;
      this.send({ type: 'hello', name: playerName });
    };
  }
}
```

## 19.2 Message Protocol Design

![Eight typed JSON frames split into client-to-server (hello, input, block_edit, chat) and server-to-client (welcome, snapshot, block_update, chat) — each frame is a small example payload showing the `type` discriminator and its fields](../illustrations/19-message-protocol.svg)

Messages are JSON objects with a `type` field and type-specific payload. All messages are one of:

| Direction | Type | Payload | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|---------|
| C2S | `hello` | `{ name }` | Join request |
| S2C | `welcome` | `{ id, world }` | Accepted, world state |
| C2S | `input` | `{ seq, position, yaw, pitch, ... }` | Player input/state |
| S2C | `snapshot` | `{ seq, players[], blocks[] }` | World state broadcast |
| C2S | `block_edit` | `{ action, x, y, z, type }` | Block place/break |
| S2C | `block_update` | `{ x, y, z, type, author }` | Block change broadcast |
| C2S | `chat` | `{ message }` | Send chat message |
| S2C | `chat` | `{ from, message }` | Broadcast chat message |

## 19.3 Connection Lifecycle

```
Client                    Server
  │                         │
  │────── hello ──────────►│  Authenticate, assign ID
  │◄───── welcome ────────│  Send world state
  │                         │
  │◄───── snapshot ───────│  Periodic state broadcast (20 Hz)
  │────── input ─────────►│  Client sends player state
  │                         │
  │────── block_edit ─────►│  Block modification request
  │◄───── block_update ───│  Broadcast to all clients
```

## 19.4 The Server Architecture

![One Node.js Server process holding a Map of WorldRooms; each room owns its own simulation loop, world state, and player connection list, with incoming sockets routed from a Lobby into a named room](../illustrations/19-server-rooms.svg)

The server (`server/src/server.ts`) manages multiple world rooms:

```typescript
class Server {
  private _rooms = new Map<string, WorldRoom>();

  onConnection(ws: WebSocket): void {
    const conn = new LobbyConn(ws);
    conn.on('join_world', (worldName) => {
      const room = this._rooms.get(worldName) ?? new WorldRoom(worldName);
      room.addPlayer(conn);
    });
  }
}
```

Each `WorldRoom` runs its own simulation loop, broadcasts snapshots, and validates block edits:

```typescript
class WorldRoom {
  private _players: PlayerConn[] = [];
  private _world: World;  // Server-side world state

  broadcast(data: object, except?: PlayerConn): void {
    for (const player of this._players) {
      if (player !== except) player.send(data);
    }
  }

  snapshot(): void {
    // Send all player positions and world changes
    this.broadcast({
      type: 'snapshot',
      players: this._players.map(p => p.snapshot()),
      blocks: this._pendingBlockUpdates,
    });
    this._pendingBlockUpdates = [];
  }
}
```

### Server-Side Authorization

![Block edit message flowing through three server-side checks — within reach distance, target block exists / placement is adjacent, edit rate sane — before being applied to the authoritative world and broadcast to peers](../illustrations/19-server-authoritative.svg)

Block edits are validated on the server to prevent cheating. The server checks that the block being broken is within the player's reach distance and that the block being placed is adjacent to an existing block and within reach.

## 19.5 World State Persistence

Local worlds are saved to IndexedDB in the browser. Server-side worlds are persisted to disk as JSON or a simple binary format:

```typescript
class WorldRepository {
  async save(worldName: string, chunks: Chunk[]): Promise<void> {
    // Serialize chunk data and write to disk
  }

  async load(worldName: string): Promise<Chunk[]> {
    // Read and deserialize chunk data
  }
}
```

Auto-save runs every 30 seconds, writing only the chunks that have been modified since the last save. The server also saves on graceful shutdown.

### 19.6 Summary

The multiplayer architecture uses WebSockets with a dedicated Node.js server:

- **Message protocol**: 8 JSON message types covering connection, input, block edits, and chat
- **Server architecture**: `WorldRoom` per world with simulation loop, player list, and state
- **Authorization**: Server-side reach distance checks, adjacency validation, rate limiting
- **Persistence**: IndexedDB for client, JSON/binary disk for server, 30 s autosave
